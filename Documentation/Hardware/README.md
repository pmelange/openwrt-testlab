## Building the Pi
In order to build the HATs onto the Pi, some modifications need to be done to the Serial Expansion HAT when more than one of these boards are used.  Specifically modifiying the I2C Address and Interrupt.  In addition, solder 90Â° Pin Headers to the GPIO sockets.

In this example, 5 Serial Expansion HATs are used.  They are configured with the following settings
* Board 1: INT 24, I2C Address 0x48 (A1 -> 3V3, A0 -> 3V3) _Default Configuration_
* Board 2: INT 23, I2C Address 0x49 (A1 -> 3V3, A0 -> GND)
* Board 3: INT 22, I2C Address 0x4A (A1 -> 3V3, A0 -> SCL)
* Board 4: INT 21, I2C Address 0x4B (A1 -> 3V3, A0 -> SDA)
* Board 5: INT 20, I2C Address 0x4C (A1 -> GND, A0 -> 3V3)

Above each of the Relay Boards install a Stacking Header.  The reason for this is because the screw terminals on the Realy Board are too high to stack the HATs without them.  In addition, remove the jumpers from the Realy Boards as we will be wiring them directly to the GPIO pins on the Serial Extension HATs.

Optional: Create a Prototype Board which has a Stacking Header on one end to stack on top of the Raspberry Pi and expands the number of 5V and GND pins to power the additional Relay Modules.  While creating this board, it was not yet clear if 3.3V or 5V would be used.  In addition the IRQ Pins 25 and 26 were added for convenience as these are used to control the power relays for power sockets AUX1 and AUX2.
