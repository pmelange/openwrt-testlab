# The Serial Expansion HAT

The [Serial Expansion HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/serial-expansion-hat.htm), created by Waveshare adds an SC16IS752 serial controller which brings an additional 2 UARTs and 8 GPIOs.  Multiple of these HATs can be stacked to provide more UARTs and GPIOs.  The UARTs have device names in the format /dev/ttySCX (where X is a number starting at 0).

## Multiple Serial Expansion HATs

When using multiple Serial Expansion HATs, a bit of soldering needs to be done.  Specifically modifiying the I2C Address and Interrupt. In addition, soldering 90Â° Pin Headers to the GPIO sockets.

For the testlab, 5 Serial Expansion HATs are used.  They are configured with the following settings
* Board 1: INT 24, I2C Address 0x48 (A1 -> 3V3, A0 -> 3V3) _Default Configuration_
* Board 2: INT 23, I2C Address 0x49 (A1 -> 3V3, A0 -> GND)
* Board 3: INT 22, I2C Address 0x4A (A1 -> 3V3, A0 -> SCL)
* Board 4: INT 21, I2C Address 0x4B (A1 -> 3V3, A0 -> SDA)
* Board 5: INT 20, I2C Address 0x4C (A1 -> GND, A0 -> 3V3)

## The GPIO Pins

One row of GPIO pins is used in connection with each of the attached UARTs.  For UART "a", GPIO pins 0, 2, 4, and 6 are reserved, while for UART "b" GPIO pins 1, 3, 5, and 7 are reserved.  GPIO pins 0 and 1 are used to control the power relays for their power sockets while GPIO pins 2 and 3 are used to control the reset button relays.

## The Linux Kernel

The Linux kernel is hard coded with a maximum of 8 UARTs controlled via connected SC16IS752 chips.  The reason for this limit is not clear and is probably a case of "8 should be enough".  With a small modification to the kernel, this can be easily increased to 16.  A patch can be seen [here](../RaspiOS/0001-sc16is7xx.c-increase-SC16IS7XX_MAX_DEVS-to-16.patch).  For more information about how to compile and install the Linux kernel, please take a look at the documentation at raspberrypi.com page [Installing Raspberry Pi OS](../RaspiOS).

## Device Tree overlay for the SC16IS752

To install the kernel module for the Serial Expansion HAT, the file ```/boot/firmware/config.txt``` needs to be edited to add the following _(modify the interrupt pin and address as needed)_.  

NOTE: the oder of the ```dtoverlay``` entries seems to be important in so far as to the ordering of ```/dev/ttySCX``` and which gpiochipY is assigned to which HAT.   In this example, the HAT with address 0x48 is assigned ```/dev/ttySC0``` and ```/dev/ttySC1``` along with gpiochip2 while the HAT with address 0x4c is assigned ```/dev/ttySC8``` ```/dev/ttySC9``` and gpiochip6.
