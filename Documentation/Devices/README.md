Devices which are to be attached to the openwrt-testlab normally need some modifications to the hardware to provide access to the TTY serial interface and the reset button.  In addition, some basic information about how the device functions is needed for the test software to function properly.  For example, the baud rate of the TTY serial interface and how to get a device to load an initramfs-kernel via the bootloader.

Each device has it's own dedicated documentation which describes in detail how to modify it.
